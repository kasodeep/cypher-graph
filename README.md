# Cypher Learning Repository

Welcome to my `Cypher` Learning repository! Here you'll find notes, queries, and resources related to learning Cypher, the query language for `Neo4j` graph databases.

## About Cypher

Cypher is a powerful, declarative query language that allows you to interact with graph data in Neo4j. It's designed to be intuitive and expressive, making it easy to query and manipulate `graph structures`.
