The Neo4j components that are used to define the graph data model are:
1) Nodes
2) Labels
3) Relationships
4) Properties

Refactoring is very common in the development process.

Types of Models:
When performing the graph data modeling process for an application, you will need at least two types of models:
1) Data model
2) Instance model

The nouns are used to define the nodes.
The verbs are used to define the relationship.

When you define a property for a relationship, it is because your use cases ask a
specific question about how two nodes are related, not just that they are related.

A really important factor with testing the graph is scalability. 
How will these queries perform if the graph has millions of nodes or relationships?

IMP) Refractoring Graph!
To refactor a graph data model and a graph, you must:
1) Design the new data model.
2) Write Cypher code to transform the existing graph to implement the new data model.
3) Retest all use cases, possibly with updated Cypher code.

Refactoring to specialize relationships:
Relationships are fast to traverse and they do not take up a lot of space in the graph.
